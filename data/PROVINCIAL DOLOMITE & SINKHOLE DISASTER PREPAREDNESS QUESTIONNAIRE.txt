Slindo Mavuso started transcription

Slindo Mavuso   0:03
That you have been most represented.

Raymond Durrheim   0:06
Hmm.

Slindo Mavuso   0:07
Yeah, yeah. Oh, cool. Yeah. I I'm just, like, hit the ground running. To be honest, it's been an insane like, couple of weeks. Essentially, they asked me to be part of this project.
They figured they need someone who's actually worked in the in the cradle area and who's worked on these types of rocks, so they kind of asked me last minutes and someone who has actually done some like, you know, social work with the communities there. So they were like, OK, cool.
But like, yeah it's. I mean it seems pretty interesting. So I was like I it would be a nice subject to to get along with. Yeah, I understand it's.

Raymond Durrheim   0:38
Yeah.
Because when I saw the company that had that company that had been contracted as they seem to be the main business seem to be catering and community events.

Slindo Mavuso   0:55
Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean they, so they were the ones that actually asked me to be to do this part for them as well. I know one of the people that was for the company and she's like, please save us.

Raymond Durrheim   0:57
So.
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   1:10
I think they pitched for the entire thing and yeah, so I'm kind of coming in very much like catching up, trying to sort it out. Even their deadlines were are insane. But well, I think it'll be fine. It should. Shouldn't be too much of an issue. Yeah, so.

Raymond Durrheim   1:23
The.

Slindo Mavuso   1:27
Yeah. So I understand that you also were part of the the.
The round table.

Raymond Durrheim   1:37
That's correct. I attended it and I made a presentation and spent the day there. Yes.

Slindo Mavuso   1:38
Yeah.
Oh, awesome. Great. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, if you. I mean, if you have the presentation, probably shouldn't be much that I have to sort of have to say to you. Yeah. I mean, I'm just going to sort of be. Yeah. So we've kind of identified you as sort of like the, you know.
The mining side of of of everything, the mining you know relates to sinkhole risk and the post closure instabilities that are sort of associated with with these things with these sinkholes. Yeah. So yeah, I. Yeah, my first question sort of like from your perspective like what's the one?

Raymond Durrheim   2:13
Uh-huh.

Slindo Mavuso   2:19
A big distinguishing thing between mining related sinkhole risk from like infrastructure or land use sinkholes in in the dolomitic terrain so like which ones would be like more mines and which ones would be more caustic. Essentially in your in your in your opinion or can you tell the difference?

Raymond Durrheim   2:38
Well, it's, you know, it's it's quite I got the sense that a lot of people they really didn't understand the problem they're dealing with. So firstly, when you're talking about mining, you have you have coal mines, shallow coal mines around Benoni, that sort of area just other side the airport.

Slindo Mavuso   2:39
None.
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   2:58
And we've done. And so you, there's these mines were mined out 100 years ago in the 1930s. And so they would like to redevelop the land and they don't know exactly where the mines were. And so for example, we a friend and colleague who's got a geotechnical consultancy, Tony Abair, he, you know, said why don't we come?

Slindo Mavuso   3:09
And.

Raymond Durrheim   3:18
Do some work together. So we did, you know, testing our techniques with one of our pH. D students and others that work at that site. And so that's looking at shallow coal mines, OK, then you've got all the issues along the gold mining areas.
Where you've got there's, I suppose you've got legal miners who go in there and doing work and but the problems really when it comes to sinkholes are the illegal miners who go into the old mine workings and then dig away.

Slindo Mavuso   3:46
And.

Raymond Durrheim   3:49
In an uncontrolled way along strike, and you know with taking no account of where infrastructure is, where roads might be, your pipelines are, and so you get that collapsing. So that's, I suppose the shallow gold mining.
And then you've got the whole issue in the far West Rand, where you've had money where you've got your deep minds and what has been done there is well you'd get in those dolomitic areas, you'd get sinkholes would happen from time to time in geological time.

Slindo Mavuso   4:20
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   4:21
But in order to make the mining safer because they had a really dangerous in Russia because normally they, you know, they'd sunk their shaft through the Pretoria group through the Tunis port and then into the gold bearing strata, that rotten supergroup below, when they first started mining in the Cardinal area, they trusted that there would be a seal.

Slindo Mavuso   4:31
None.
Yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   4:41
In the mine workings and the and the these you know, these are enormous aquifers above, above there. But there was a very near what I suppose when it wasn't a disaster, only one person lost his life from a heart attack rather than from being drowned. That of course, that was when there was when the seal broke and there was a massive.

Slindo Mavuso   4:46
Hmm.
Yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   5:00
Of inrush of water into the mine workings and then they made a decision to dewater the whole area. The whole of the far West ran because you find your government. You would have your ***** and ***** that are intrude and there are many different generations. Act a bit of there's dam walls and divides into into compartments.
And so basically they pumped all that water out, drained the aquifer. The Moir River, which the at the one side of the one compartment, there's a dam and the water accumulates, it gets put into a quite a big pipe, I suppose 1 1/2 metres diameter can't remember exactly, but I've seen it. I've driven along it until it decamped.

Slindo Mavuso   5:37
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   5:40
20 kilometres downstream and so that's. And so you found that when you were dewatering and that led to a whole spate of of sinkholes, some with deadly consequences, some very dramatic ones. And what you find ever since then, as you know, these sinkholes.

Slindo Mavuso   5:40
Name.
Mm-hmm.
MMM.

Raymond Durrheim   5:59
Also occurred from time to time. You you back those early ones there was the the famous blayford Acer disaster where you know several houses were swallowed up and you know, a whole family in the middle of the night disappeared. There was the reduction works at Griffontaine, which also plunged on. And I think it's something like 30 mine workers who can read this all about on.

Slindo Mavuso   6:10
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   6:19
Wikipedia. So. So yeah, so they D watered and then since then, you know, the you'd still get the odd sinkhole from time to time and programmes, all sorts of techniques were used to try to map these.

Slindo Mavuso   6:20
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   6:35
And to see where the risks were greatest. I mean, I've also been involved in this is not just in the mining context. I've been in residential areas, places like Centurion and you know where you you, you of course. Again it's all got to do with urbanisation expanding of into, I suppose wanted to develop areas.

Slindo Mavuso   6:41
None.

Raymond Durrheim   6:53
And and of course, what's happened in the West Rand has been uncontrolled settlement and also, you know, when you do build on dolomitic area ideally you should do a thorough survey beforehand and which involves both geophysics, microgravity, other methods, drilling in order to identify.

Slindo Mavuso   7:07
None.

Raymond Durrheim   7:13
Or more and which are less stable areas, but it would seem. And again I'm I've sort of been involved on and off in the sector since, I guess since you know, since 1980 really. So for 45 years, but not it's not been my, my my focus. So I've got I suppose a long term view but not I'm not the other people who've got a lot more.

Slindo Mavuso   7:15
Yeah.
There, yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   7:33
Detailed knowledge of this, but a lot of this settlement seems to have happened in a bit of a haphazard and uncontrolled way, and what's very important, you know, is that you control your, your, your rainfall, your runoff water, your storm water, because that if it seeps into the groundwater you find in between these pinnacles, you get.

Slindo Mavuso   7:46
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   7:51
This what they call WOD, which is the sort of manganese earth and it washes away quite easily. You find your near surface. I mean, this is an old erosion surface, as you know, so it forms. It's a quite a hard crust. So you can get things washed away underneath which you're completely oblivious to.

Slindo Mavuso   7:54
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   8:07
And then bang, all of a sudden you've got a sinkhole as big as as big as a house as big as a tennis court, you know? And and and and then.

Slindo Mavuso   8:07
Mm-hmm.
Immediately, yeah.
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   8:16
All the work and the of course, it could always be more work done. We've even as as a school, you know, done work at Young Smuts House around, you know, we had as a whole team project in in Irene as as a case study because there it's subsiding and we did that with a joint hydrological, geophysical, geological study and that was a nice little.

Slindo Mavuso   8:24
MMM.
Only.

Raymond Durrheim   8:36
Thing that we did with a bunch of us, and we've also been doing projects under the, you know, in the Centurion area under the under the motorways, and if you want, I can send you my report, which I'll just touch on these topics that we we've researched.

Slindo Mavuso   8:44
Hmm.
Yes, please do actually. I mean, I think this would be that would be a little bit more a better use of your time actually just reading the report, yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   8:54
Yes, they then repeated it, but but you know, so to me there are a whole host of different problems. I mean, of course, when they're all the sinkholes that are not related to, I suppose to mining in my own suburb of Kensington, there's a sinkhole that's been in the middle of an intersection due to I suppose it's.
A leaking ground water pipe, which would have washed away the back full and so this is a whole. I suppose it's about a metre across, but it's right in the middle of the road and so I'll keep Kensington clean, some enterprising resident put a Christmas tree there. I can send you a photograph inside the whole, you know, but that's another top.

Slindo Mavuso   9:16
Hmm.
None.
It's crazy.

Raymond Durrheim   9:33
Topic that's really got to do with infrastructure maintenance and the full but anyway, so get back to mining. So you've got coal mining, shallow coal mining in the Benoni area. You've got all the Zuma Zuma issues, which is terribly difficult to police. And I know at times there have been people and the Council with Geoscience was charged with going to.

Slindo Mavuso   9:37
Yeah, I mean.
Hello.
Hmm.
None.
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   10:12
Burrow around the side is it's very difficult to secure all these these these areas and you know and then you've got your areas around carltonville more and where where they have had I suppose being dewatered that's a now uncontrolled settlement.

Slindo Mavuso   10:15
Not pretty much, yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   10:33
Work control of groundwater, not proper time planning beforehand, just as all I suppose, I think all these things are manageable but haven't been managed and to dial away the the dial the clock back.

Slindo Mavuso   10:44
MMM.
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   10:50
Is very difficult. And yeah, I think I think it's been, it's been, it's not to my mind, it's not so much a technical problem that we you know it's been a failure to apply of government's failure of time, planning, failure of enforcement, it's failure on on all those levels.

Slindo Mavuso   10:50
Hmm.
Yeah, it's kind of.

Raymond Durrheim   11:09
Technical knowledge is there. There's always opportunities to do things maybe better or more efficiently and to improve our techniques to find these sinkholes, but yet they do seem to be things that develop very difficult. You know, sometimes it seems that you will get substance, a big hole appearing without any.

Slindo Mavuso   11:09
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   11:28
Precursory warning. You know it's it's, yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   11:30
Yeah, I mean I I do. I mean, I think from what I'm getting and from what I've been sort of wrapping my head around, this is definitely going beyond the dolomitic sinkhole project. It's like a sinkhole issue of structural stuff. It's the mining.
It's the. Yeah, it's the mining. It's it's the infrastructure. And it is also sort of the the. Yeah, obviously the the plastic work that has been happening with the, with the mines. So it's a lot of stuff. So which I also, I mean I did mention this in there in the first meeting that I feel like you guys are not actually capturing the whole scope of these.
Umm.
Of what is actually going on. You know it sounds very responsive and I think I don't think a lot of there weren't a lot of scientists that were on that are on the government to be like, hey, listen, this is, this goes beyond just.

Raymond Durrheim   12:08
Hmm.
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   12:21
Yeah, just one, one or two events in, in, in, in the Ranfantaine area, it actually is. It's going around and it's a lot of different events and that's I'm glad that you sort of picking like you sort of articulated that because that wasn't really something that they were.
That I I saw in the transcripts because I couldn't be at the at the at the round table so I didn't really see that at the at the transcript and yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   12:44
Yeah, I mean, look, there were there was somebody there from the Council of Geoscience and non Velo and she gave because they've over the years they've been sort of custodians for this. And there was something called the Dolomitic Water Association. But they've been doing surveys there.

Slindo Mavuso   12:47
Mm-hmm.
Amen.

Raymond Durrheim   12:58
For decades, you know, and they've got a lot of or had a lot of experience. Of course, they've lost a lot of the older staff have moved on, but the capacity and so there's a lot of that institutional memory I'm afraid, is is gone. I mean, when I did my as a white male growing up in the 1970s, I did national service and I was seconded to the geological.

Slindo Mavuso   13:00
Mm-hmm.
Angel.
The capacity.
Yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   13:18
Survey and to the Engineering Geology division and our job was to do site investigations in military areas because what was foetric or wukta.

Slindo Mavuso   13:19
None.
Hmm.
We're the meeting. James. James. I'm the meeting. Sorry. It's my move. My girlfriend? Yeah, OK. It's fine. Then. I'm just saying, if you see a little a little boy moving here.

Raymond Durrheim   13:31
No problem. It's all blurry behind. Yeah, OK.
OK, I can see a blur. I can't see the detail. Yeah, that's so. So. Yeah. So, you know, it's a place like fortrick or wukta tawatrani's built on dolomitic area swap Court, Air Force Base. All these areas I've I was involved in citing investigations.

Slindo Mavuso   13:42
Yeah. OK.
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   13:57
There and and elsewhere, you know. So this is a that the Council for Geoscience was the agency that was responsible for the basic geological mapping. They've been a lot of guidelines published, you know, as to what you should do. So there's a lot of the literature and what should be done and how to rehabilitate these things when they happen.

Slindo Mavuso   13:57
None.
None.

Raymond Durrheim   14:16
Of course, it's expensive to do. I think people you know so, but yeah, so there's a lot of knowledge. There's no, there's no magical bullet. There's no elasto plastic.

Slindo Mavuso   14:18
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, from what it seems.
Yeah, there's no like silver bullet is going to fix everything. I mean, from what it seems, it's quite multifaceted. And I I did, I did mention this that I feel like a lot of this stuff already can be remedied with a like competence, but it is becoming like quite AI think. But it seems like a lot of the.

Raymond Durrheim   14:43
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   14:46
The reason why they're doing this because they will. Well, I'm sort of putting helping them put a report together is that they do want to sort of capacitate they want sort of like an empirical reason to ask the government for more money to handle these disasters, which they should be asking the government for more money to stop them from happening in the first place.

Raymond Durrheim   15:01
Yeah.
Yes.

Slindo Mavuso   15:07
Yeah. So I think that's, that's just something that I'm, I mean, I'm having a meeting with them on Thursday and then I think something that I think should really sort of like reshift the whole focus of the of of, of, of, of that. So yeah, I mean.
And just in terms of, I mean yeah, please do send me the report. I think that that that would be a a more useful sort of exercise in me looking at the sub type of stuff that you guys have sort of used like the techniques and stuff like that to to to sort of, I mean the one I know sort of.

Raymond Durrheim   15:37
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   15:38
Well, I I know I've been hearing a lot about it is, is Lidar. I hear that that's pretty low like a low, not low car, but high, high high yields, low low, low effort. What do you maybe have any other ones that would sort of not like a silver bullet in terms of like actually now detecting?
Where these areas are the high risk areas are and what that would mean.

Raymond Durrheim   16:02
Well, the standard techniques are, you know, are microgravity gravity and I think that's still very good today. You also do various resistivity techniques. You do ground penetrating radar, you do their various seismic techniques also for mapping cavities. And then also, you know way back they were doing things like Firefly.

Slindo Mavuso   16:04
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   16:22
Infrared that fly. These at the coldest times because you find again areas which are now but saturated. But sponge like would which which would show up and so yeah, so there are a whole range. There's a whole toolbox and again, yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   16:23
Mm-hmm.
With the with heats. Yeah, exactly.
OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, I, I mean, I think, yeah, I think that's it. I mean, and you did sort of answer the you kind of the intro, I was going to have a whole section on the groundwater and how that's making stuff worse or like the the the removal of groundwater. Yeah. And I didn't really think about the.

Raymond Durrheim   16:37
The.
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   16:54
The the I I know that it was it was affecting around infrastructure but I didn't think that it was actually infrastructural issues that were that were happening.

Raymond Durrheim   17:05
Yeah. So it's not only managing the, the managing the storm water, but you've got leakage of your sewage pipes. So you've got leakage of your water supply pipes you know, so you know, so these are.

Slindo Mavuso   17:08
And.
None.
Yeah, on on, like quite unstable grounds, to be honest. I mean, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess that that seems like, yeah, I mean, yeah. And you also answered I was like going to ask, like, the biggest misconception decision we have to think about sinkholes and mining risk is, is the is, I think it's the idea that.

Raymond Durrheim   17:18
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   17:33
You can just fix it immediately. I think it's very mass attached to the geology is very complicated. The history of the geology is also quite complicated it seems, and a lot of things need to be considered, so it should. I wouldn't say case by case, but they should this clearly.

Raymond Durrheim   17:39
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   17:49
Like these very big, overarching kind of situations that 'cause these thing holes and I think they should be handled not compartmentally, but they should be understood that it's when a single happens. It's not just one 'cause it's not because there's a cave underneath that finally gave in or that it's.
It's a mine. It's always a Mazama or it's or it's it's. There's a lot of different factors that can actually 'cause these mines to happen, and I don't think they're thinking around. I don't think that's what they their minds are because they think of disasters like every other disaster outside of this. I mean, would be like.

Raymond Durrheim   18:14
Hmm.
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   18:26
Something instantaneous, right? Like an earthquake? OK. Or it would be like a a fire that that's above ground, you know? So I don't think that all that that would have sort of like one effect or one cause. So I think, yeah, I don't think they were really.

Raymond Durrheim   18:29
Yes.
None.

Slindo Mavuso   18:43
Thinking around that section, and I mean, I did start writing the report around like that, like that. It's not as there's a few different reasons why the sinkholes exist, and because even the word calling it the dolomite sinkhole project is a bit of a misnomer in a way.

Raymond Durrheim   18:59
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   19:00
Because it's not only caused by the Dolomites, you know. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot more stuff, especially in the rampant in area. Yes, it it does intersect with the Dolomites. Yes. Are the ones at the top. But there's a lot of stuff happening beneath that, and there's a lot of stuff that's happening around that as well.
And I it seems like that's really the big, big issue around this this whole project. So I I'll report back to them though. Do you maybe know who else I could chat about to to get more of this, the history and the stuff?

Raymond Durrheim   19:16
Hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, I think I will send you. I mean you you would have seen the people who gave the talks at at the round table, but a few weeks before that they in fact there was a a conference at at the Rosebank Sun Hotel were jointly offered by the Geophysical Association, the South African Institute of Engineering geologists where that.

Slindo Mavuso   19:37
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   19:51
You know where? There are quite a few papers there. I can send you the programme and perhaps some of the presentations from that meeting, because those are consultants that are very well and that beautiful presentations, I mean, the thing that upsets me is there's nobody from the City of Johannesburg or the Kharting province. They don't seem to interact with the scientific or professional.

Slindo Mavuso   19:57
Yes, that would that would be great.
Yeah.
None.
Yeah, yeah. I mean, this is something I'm going to like.
Yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   20:14
Don't you know they just, I guess, sit in their office. Who knows we're in and I don't know what they they they organise round tables, you know, at a casino and and.

Slindo Mavuso   20:16
Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, they do this pretty often. I mean, I'm having, I mean, I'm trying to, I'm helping them out now and yeah, the the amount of times I have to remind myself that this is for greater cause.

Raymond Durrheim   20:40
No, indeed, I mean, that's what I do. It is, you know.

Slindo Mavuso   20:42
Because I'm like, I'll screw this. I I can just go and look at my blue photos, whatever. But yeah, I mean, yeah, but thanks for the insight. Please do send me the programme and and the report and anything else that you think might be useful. I'll sift through it, get try and get a bit more perspectives because I am really thinking about.

Raymond Durrheim   20:46
Yeah.
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   21:00
Yeah, I'm. I really think if we're going to do this, we should do this properly or lay the groundwork at least properly. Yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   21:03
Yeah.
Yeah. And I'd be very happy to read what you write, you know, and just give you, you know, and edit it whatever or add a few ideas if need me and.

Slindo Mavuso   21:09
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, sure, sure thing. I I really appreciate that. I mean, it's only going to happen probably in a in a month or two or three, but I would be I'll be very, very happy to, but I will definitely I I was sort of just trying to get a big sense of this interview, the people in the stakeholders.
Get a better depth of the stuff as someone who's actually a scientist and I I don't think they actually did understand essentially, what, what, what a lot of the stuff was on on online. So yeah, please give me the, the, the, the. Yeah, the programme I think would be good and the report would be a really good.
Would save me a lot of energy. I think in terms of trying to like start this from scratch, you know?

Raymond Durrheim   21:46
Yeah.
I mean, I mean quite frankly also one of the fellows though is that has got brought in here now. I'm also doing a similar thing for the City of Johannesburg, but he's a fellow who's AI. Suppose a postdoc down at University of the Free State and he's AGIS specialist.

Slindo Mavuso   21:57
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   22:05
And he's talking and I think he might even have got a contract to build an incredible GIS model, but frankly has very little understanding of the geology of Johannesburg, basically, or even on things that are geological. So I can see there's a great, you know, I think Agis model, if that doesn't exist, it should exist, I thought.

Slindo Mavuso   22:10
And.
Hmm.

Raymond Durrheim   22:24
With you know that I don't know what's all in that that space.

Slindo Mavuso   22:25
None.
Play song.
Yeah, I mean, I do think there should be like a live GIS model should exist, you know, like having areas high, high risk areas like you would have in a in a in a you know like an earthquake rich place you always have places that are on alert if something funny happens, you would sort of know where everything is around should be happening around that kind of stuff. They should definitely be something.

Raymond Durrheim   22:44
Hmm.

Slindo Mavuso   22:48
Like that and then it can only be informed by people with a good sense of understanding. In geology, you know a geologist can learn GIS, but AGIS person cannot learn geology in like a year you know. So I don't think there should be more geologists within the city. I guess to sort of lead to that charge.

Raymond Durrheim   22:53
Yeah, but, you know quite a.
Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, it's interesting in the in the, I suppose the geophysics Community Society for Exploration geophysicists right now, they're having a whole programme on urban geophysics is, you know, how you apply duty in the city to address problems like this and other.

Slindo Mavuso   23:08
Well, thanks.
Aye.
Hmm.
Yeah.

Raymond Durrheim   23:23
Other other problems, because mostly we work out in the, you know, the Bush when we do mineral prospecting and those things are not that much in in urban areas because it's difficult to work in urban areas with all your services and traffic and noise and yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   23:31
Yeah.
Yeah. And I mean it's it's clearly necessary, right? Like if we have to like, it's the question area for two weeks to get a good sense of the thing that all we should we should be working in, you know during the holidays when everyone is away from Johannesburg, then it's something that really.

Raymond Durrheim   23:41
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   23:56
It needs to be discussed, you know? Yeah. All right. Yeah. I don't know if you have any other any other questions or things. I'm just looking through my list. Yeah. But I mean, it seems like it seems like.

Raymond Durrheim   23:57
Yeah, yeah. Good. I will.

Slindo Mavuso   24:13
Yeah. Everything that I would want that I prepared to ask you, you sort of gave me a good understanding of. So. Thank you so much for for making the time. I guess I'll see you next week again. Yeah, yeah, I'm.

Raymond Durrheim   24:27

Slindo Mavuso   24:45
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I should be there because I start teaching at the beginning of April, so that should be, yeah, I should be there. And I'm going. I'm going back next week for I'm going back next week for sorry. I'm just going to. Somebody is fighting for time.

Raymond Durrheim   24:49

Slindo Mavuso   25:04
Yeah, I'm. I'm. I'm going the next week for for sub exams and I'm probably going to stay. I'm going to stick around. I'll come. I'll come up to Joburg for a week just to sort of the final parts of my of my hand in like actually the actual document is done. So just to just to wrap everything up.

Raymond Durrheim   25:11
Yeah.

Slindo Mavuso   25:21
Pack up my stuff and move it back.

Raymond Durrheim   25:23

Slindo Mavuso   25:44
I I I'm just waiting on essentially waiting on Zubair to tell me to to approve. But it's done. Yeah. I mean, we didn't really have a lot of Corrections. They were quite minor, so.
