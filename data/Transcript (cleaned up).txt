Mariette Liefferink:
My focus is on the goldfields, particularly areas such as the Carletonville and Far West Rand regions. There is an extensive body of literature on sinkhole formations in these areas. In fact, if all the reports relating to sinkholes in the Far West Rand and the Wonderfonteinspruit Catchment Management Area were stacked, they would stand several metres high.
At this stage, while we are heartened that there is finally a policy drafting process underway, we are deeply aggrieved by the fact that it has taken so many decades. Sinkhole formation has been a known phenomenon since the 1960s, following the dewatering of the Far West Rand basin.
I serve on various statutory advisory committees, forums, and task teams. I am also a guest lecturer and associated researcher, with a focus on major mining houses such as Gold Fields, as well as mine closure processes. I would also like to state clearly that we do not object to our organisation being publicly cited. In fact, we encourage that comments made during this meeting be attributed to the Federation for a Sustainable Environment.

Mariette Liefferink:
When the dewatering policy was introduced by the apartheid government, it resulted in a significant increase in seismic activity, ground movement, and sinkhole formation. It is estimated that between 1,000 and 2,000 sinkholes have formed within the Far West Rand and West Rand regions.
Following catastrophic collapses of mine infrastructure and residential dwellings, a one-metre diameter pipeline was introduced to transport water from the Donaldson Dams across dolomitic areas. This was done to prevent ponding, as it was already established that ponding of water exacerbates sinkhole formation.
Currently, due to poor wastewater management and sewage spillages, large volumes of water are again ponding in these areas, particularly around Carletonville. This creates conditions for renewed sinkhole formation.

Mariette Liefferink:
In the Khutsong area, there have been ongoing sewage spillages for many years. Although the Merafong Municipality received grants for wastewater treatment upgrades, these funds were not effectively implemented. As a result, sewage spillages continue to this day.
Reports indicate extreme levels of E. coli and faecal coliforms-often too numerous to measure-which points to systemic failure in municipal wastewater management. This is a critical contributor to sinkhole risk in dolomitic areas.

Mariette Liefferink:
Historically, when mining commenced in the late 1800s, an association existed between the Department of Water Affairs and mining companies. This arrangement ensured compensation for affected landowners and established a technical steering committee to assess the impacts of dewatering on dolomitic areas.
As gold mining has declined and ownership structures have changed, FSE requested a review of the Far West Rand Water Association. Currently, the principal party responsible for post-closure seismic activity, groundwater movement, and acid mine drainage is Sibanye-Stillwater.
A mine closure strategy was drafted proposing cooperative water management among mining companies. However, with rewatering and rising water tables, renewed sinkhole formation is anticipated due to ground instability.

14:16 - Role and Mandate of FSE
Mariette Liefferink:
South Africa continues to experience the legacy of pre-1994 environmental racism. This is why the Federation for a Sustainable Environment was established-to ensure that mining-related risks and impacts are borne by mining proponents, not communities, future generations, or the environment.
We focus on sustainable economic development, applying the best practicable environmental option-meaning the option that causes the least harm and is preferred by affected communities. We also emphasise mine closure planning from the outset of mining operations.
We engage extensively with local and international universities, UN Special Rapporteurs, and affected communities. Over the past 15 years, we have conducted site visits involving between 50,000 and 80,000 community members. We rely on scientific reports, government documents, litigation outcomes, and direct observation of impacts such as acid mine drainage, sinkhole formation, and tailings management failures.

14:25 - Impacts of Dolomite Instability
Mariette Liefferink:
Sinkhole formation represents a fundamental infringement of the right to life, as it can result in fatalities. It also infringes on the right to dignity. In areas such as Khutsong, children are seen playing in sewage-contaminated water.
There are long-term psychological impacts as well. The loss of a sense of place-when a residential area becomes a high-risk zone-has deep therapeutic and social consequences. Communities face not only immediate danger, but long-term loss of property, assets, and livelihoods.

14:29 - Policy and Governance Gaps
Mariette Liefferink:
South Africa has sufficient laws, policies, and strategies. The problem lies in implementation and enforcement. Environmental Impact Assessments frequently identify sinkhole risks and mitigation measures, yet these are not enforced.
Municipalities are legally required to prevent sewage spillages and water ponding, but this often does not occur. Corruption and institutional failure play a significant role in exacerbating these risks.

14:37 - Coordination Challenges
Mariette Liefferink:
One of the major challenges is the conflict of interest within the Department of Mineral and Petroleum Resources, which both promotes mining and acts as an environmental regulator.
While some mining companies are willing to engage and provide information, there is often a lack of accountability and enforcement by regulators. The National Mine Closure Strategy has been completed but has remained unsigned for several years, which undermines coordinated post-closure risk management.

14:48 - Priority Actions for the Strategy
Mariette Liefferink:
First, the strategy must be legally enforceable. A strategy without regulatory force cannot protect communities.
Second, wastewater treatment works must be upgraded, and sewage spillages in dolomitic areas must be eliminated. Polluters-including municipal managers, mining executives, and operators-must be held criminally accountable.
Third, the National Mine Closure Strategy must be formally adopted and implemented, and the Technical Steering Committee on sinkhole formation should be re-established.
All the views I have expressed are supported by extensive scientific and government reports, many of which I have shared with you.

Closing
Mariette Liefferink:
You are welcome to contact me again, and I also extend an invitation for site visits to mining-affected areas, which I am authorised to host.
Neani Mphela:
Thank you very much for your time and contribution.
